## How MovieBox Works (Backend)

MovieBox is powered by a robust backend built using the NestJS framework. Here's an overview of how it operates:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**  
  - The backend uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.  
  - Role-based access control ensures that users have appropriate permissions for specific actions.

2. **Database Management**  
  - MovieBox uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user data, movie details, and other related information.  
  - TypeORM is utilized as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for seamless database interactions.

3. **RESTful API**  
  - The backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs for client applications to interact with.  
  - These APIs handle operations such as user registration, login, movie search, and favorites management.

4. **Movie Data Integration**  
  - MovieBox integrates with third-party APIs (e.g., TMDb) to fetch up-to-date movie information, including titles, genres, ratings, and trailers.

5. **Caching**  
  - Frequently accessed data, such as popular movies, is cached using Redis to improve performance and reduce API calls.

6. **Error Handling**  
  - Centralized error handling ensures that users receive meaningful error messages and that the system remains stable.

7. **Scalability**  
  - The backend is designed to handle high traffic with features like horizontal scaling and load balancing.  
  - Docker is used for containerization, making deployment consistent and efficient.

8. **Testing**  
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests are implemented to ensure the reliability of the backend.  
  - Tools like Jest are used for automated testing.

With these features, MovieBox provides a seamless and efficient experience for users, ensuring reliability and scalability for future growth.
